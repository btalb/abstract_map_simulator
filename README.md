# Using the Abstract Map in a 2D Stage simulation

![2D Stage simulation with with simulated tags](./docs/abstract_map_simulation.png)

Package contains everything needed to simulate the zoo experiments performed in our [IEEE TCDS journal](https://doi.org/10.1109/TCDS.2020.2993855). The package includes: 
- world & launch files for a stage simulation of the GP-S11 environment on QUT's Gardens Point campus
- a tool for creating simulated tags in an environment & saving them to file,
- launch & config files for using the move_base navigation stack with gmapping to explore unseen simulated environments

## Installing the abstract map simulator

*Note: this is just the simulator; to use the abstract map with the simulator please make sure you use the [abstract_map](https://github.com/btalb/abstract_map) package*

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/btalb/abstract_map_simulator
```

Add the new package to your ROS workspace at `<ROS_WS>/` by linking in the cloned repository:
```
ln -s <LOCATION_REPO_WAS_CLONED_ABOVE> <ROS_WS>/src/
```

Install all of the listed ROS dependencies, and build the package:
```
cd <ROS_WS>/src/abstract_map_simulator
rosdep install .
cd <ROS_WS>
catkin_make
```
